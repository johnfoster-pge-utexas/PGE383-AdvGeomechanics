You will notice in the navigation bar a [Course Materials](/course-mat/) tab now.  This is where I will post the lecture PDFs and recordings as well as any additional course reference material.

For the recorded lectures, I have clipped them into topical subsections and posted them to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg" target="blank_">Course YouTube Channel</a>.  Clicking the posted link will take you to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg/playlists" target="blank_">YouTube Playlist</a> that will play the individual clips from that lecture in the sequence they were delivered.  Feel free to watch/review only the clips that are of interest to you.

For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaFDhoncLBU&list=PLyQr4689RR7BNP9HEMbiJeB2vA2ZrD4Pp" target="blank_">first lecture</a> there was a little background noise in the audio of first the first few clips. I believe I know what was causing this and will work to correct it in the future.
