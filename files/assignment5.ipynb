    "Consider a slightly asymmetric wellbore in an otherwise symmetric and homogenous medium in which the interior wellbore pressure $p_0$ is held constant.  Assuming steady-state, plane-strain and *undrained* conditions, compute the displacements and pressures on the given mesh.  The mesh information is provided in the following files with short descriptions of thier contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "[coords.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/coords.csv) - the geometric node locations for all nodes.  They are listed in $x,y$ pairs with each line corresponding to a global node index starting with 1 and proceding in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "[connect.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/connect.csv) - the connectivity arrays.  Each line contains the global node numbers of an element with local node numbering as specified in the schematic. For the pressue interpolates, only use the first 4 which will coorespond to the corners of the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "[nodeset1.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/nodeset1.csv) - the nodes on the interior boundary.  Use these nodes to specify the interior pressure, $p_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "[nodeset2.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/nodeset2.csv) - the nodes on the exterior boundary.  Use these nodes to specify the far-field pressure, $p_{\\infty}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "[nodeset3.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/nodeset3.csv) - the nodes on the horizontal symmetric boundary (indicated in blue in the schematic).\n",
    "\n",
    "[nodeset4.csv](http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/nodeset4.csv) - the nodes on the horizontal symmetric boundary (indicated in red in the schematic).\n",

    "Assume zero fluid compressibility, i.e. $1/M = 0$ and the following dimensionless properties $\\alpha = 1, \\nu = 0.3, \\mu = 1$ for Biot's coefficient, Poisson's ratio, and shear modulus, respectively.  Apply an interior pressue $p_0=5$ and a constant far-field pressure $p_{\\infty}=1$.  Assume the far field boundary is stress-free as well.  Create plots of the stress fields for $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, and $\\sigma_{xy}$ as well as the pressures."
